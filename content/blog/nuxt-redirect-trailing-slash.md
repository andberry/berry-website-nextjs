In a recent Nuxt.js project I've been working at, a SEO requirement was that all URLs had to be **with** trailing slash.

We can accomodate this request simply configuring the **router** part of the **nuxt.config.js** file:

<pre><code class="json">
router: {
    trailingSlash: true
}
</code></pre>

But now if we call the URL without the trailing slash we're going to face a 404 page.

**One possible solution is to force the trailing slash with a 301 redirect**.
This is easility possible thanks to the **@nuxtjs/redirect-module** module: let's install it and what follows is all we need to do the job:

<pre><code class="json">
redirect: [
    {
        from: '^.*(?&lt;!/)$',
        to: (from, req) => req.url + '/',
        statusCode: 301
    }
]
</code></pre>
