This is my personal website and blog I finally decided to build and publish.

I think every web developer should have his own website, just to have fun experimenting technical solutions and to share knowledge and since I'm used to take technical notes during my clients works and share with colleagues, why not publish these notes on the web and share with everybody?

Moreover this is a handsome exercise to improve my english writing skills.
